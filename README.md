🎮 **NeonBurger Digital Menu**

A cyberpunk-inspired Digital Menu Management System for *NeonBurger*, a retro-futuristic burger joint abandoning paper menus for glowing, futuristic displays. Built to let kitchen managers Add, View, Edit, and Delete menu items through a neon-lit admin dashboard. 
<br><i> Clearly, a joint like that does not exist (wouldn't it be so cool if it did, though?), this was a project idea only. </i>

📍 **The Process**

The goal was to craft a **Cyberpunk 2077 style admin dashboard**  with no white screens, no soft colours, just pure neon energy. I started by setting up a MySQL database for storing each burger's details. Then came the fun part: designing a glowing, holographic UI with sharp borders, neon cyan and pink accents, and techno fonts that feel like they’re pulled straight out of Night City.

JavaScript handles validation and dynamic interactions (like disabling spicy levels for drinks), while PHP powers the CRUD cycle behind the scenes. As a finishing touch, any item with a spicy level of 4 or 5 automatically gets a “🔥” next to its name. <br> The result? a slick, sci-fi dashboard where every card looks like a floating HUD panel.
